# Gossipy

Gossipy is a simple social media web application where users can create stations and gossip about all their fantasies!

## Motivation

As I've created multiple projects I noticed that I've not been through multiple entities projects with a lot of features all I had before were pinpoint projects which were targeted to learn a specific skill.

For the last 4 months I evolved myself into learning more new technologies and tried to apply them in Gossipy. Technologies such as GraphQL, [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server), [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) and most importantly [Typescript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) in both Apollo and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react).

## Functionality

It goes like users can have a membership at any station with many defined roles such as founder, admin or member with an active, pending or banned state! Users can post topics and vote to other people's.

Stations have a control panel that can control pretty everything about the station from picture and description to members roles modification!

Topics have the same sorting algorithms of reddit, as it goes more popular with more votes within shorter time! They could be removed by the author or the station admin or edited by only the author.
